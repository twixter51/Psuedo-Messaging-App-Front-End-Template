# DEMO Front End Implementation (Pre-Release V0.36)
-Yep, this is my code

-I hope you can learn from my code! I'll try to add more and more, Im pretty sure some stuff flat out just doesn't work because I didn't want to import

my entire system that I have set up, BUT read the comments i explain it all and it's easy to understand.



##3.6
-Foundation for downloading previously uploaded images implemented
-HomePage Refactored! Navigation doesn't work yet, but this is the basic idea of how the website is meant to look :)
